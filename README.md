🐍 My Python Journey: From Zero to Hero
Welcome to my Python journey! This repository documents my personal path of learning Python — from writing my first "Hello, World!" to building real-world projects and exploring advanced topics like machine learning and automation.

🚀 About This Journey
I started learning Python with no prior experience, driven by curiosity and the power of programming. This repo serves as:

A learning archive of everything I’ve studied

A showcase of mini projects and hands-on exercises

A motivational log to track my progress over time

📚 Learning Timeline
🟢 Beginner Phase
✅ Python Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators

✅ Control Flow: if/else, loops

✅ Functions and Modules

✅ Basic Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

🔵 Intermediate Phase
✅ Object-Oriented Programming

✅ File Handling

✅ Exception Handling

✅ Virtual Environments & Pip

✅ Working with APIs (requests)

🔴 Advanced Phase
✅ Pythonic Code & Best Practices

✅ Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)

✅ GUI Applications (Tkinter)

✅ Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy

✅ Plotting with Matplotlib & Seaborn

✅ Automation with Python (scripts, bots)

🧠 Specialized Topics
✅ Intro to Machine Learning (scikit-learn)

✅ Working with JSON, CSV, Excel

✅ Basics of Flask and Django

✅ Git & GitHub for collaboration

Each folder contains notebooks, scripts, or notes related to that level of learning.

🔧 Projects I’ve Built
📝 To-Do List CLI App

📊 Data Visualizer using Pandas + Matplotlib

🕸️ Web Scraper for News Headlines

🤖 Simple Chatbot using NLP Basics

📷 Instagram Bot (Selenium Automation)

🧠 What I Learned
How to think like a programmer

Problem-solving with code

Building practical tools and automations

Using Python to interact with the real world

💡 What's Next?
I'm currently exploring:

Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Backend Development (FastAPI, Django REST)

Competitive programming with Python
